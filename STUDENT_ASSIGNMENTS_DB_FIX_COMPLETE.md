# âœ… STUDENT ASSIGNMENTS DATA FIX COMPLETED

## Issue Fixed:
**Student Assignments Page Using Hardcoded Data Instead of Database**

### Problem:
- Student assignments page (`localhost:8080/student/assignments`) was showing hardcoded demo data
- Data was not synchronized with actual assignments from database
- Students couldn't see their real assignments and submission status

### Root Cause:
1. **Missing Backend Support**: `/api/assignments` endpoint didn't support SISWA role
2. **Hardcoded Frontend**: `StudentAssignments.tsx` was using static demo data instead of API calls

### Solution Applied:

#### 1. Backend Fixes (assignmentRoutes.js):
Added SISWA support to `getCurrentUserAssignments` function:

```javascript
} else if (userRole === 'SISWA') {
  console.log('ðŸŽ“ Student accessing assignments for their class');
  
  // Get student data to find their class
  const student = await prisma.student.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
    include: {
      class: {
        select: {
          id: true,
          name: true
        }
      }
    }
  });

  // Get assignments for student's class with their submissions
  allAssignments = await prisma.assignment.findMany({
    where: {
      classId: studentClassId,
      ...(subjectId && { subjectId }),
      ...(status && { status })
    },
    include: {
      class: { select: { id: true, name: true } },
      teacher: { select: { id: true, fullName: true } },
      subject: { select: { id: true, name: true, code: true } },
      submissions: {
        where: { studentId: userId },
        select: {
          id: true,
          status: true,
          submittedAt: true,
          score: true,
          feedback: true,
          gradedAt: true
        }
      }
    }
  });
}
```

**Special formatting for students**:
```javascript
// For students, format assignment with their submission status
if (userRole === 'SISWA') {
  const studentSubmission = assignment.submissions?.[0] || null;
  
  return {
    id: assignment.id,
    title: assignment.title,
    description: assignment.description,
    type: assignment.type,
    points: assignment.points,
    deadline: assignment.deadline,
    createdAt: assignment.createdAt,
    class: assignment.class,
    subject: assignment.subject,
    teacher: assignment.teacher,
    studentSubmission: studentSubmission ? {
      id: studentSubmission.id,
      status: studentSubmission.status,
      submittedAt: studentSubmission.submittedAt,
      score: studentSubmission.score,
      feedback: studentSubmission.feedback,
      gradedAt: studentSubmission.gradedAt
    } : null
  };
}
```

#### 2. Frontend Fixes (StudentAssignments.tsx):
Replaced hardcoded demo data with real API calls:

**BEFORE (Hardcoded)**:
```tsx
// Use demo data for now since API might not be available
const demoAssignments: Assignment[] = [
  {
    id: 'assign-1',
    title: 'Tugas Matematika - Persamaan Linear',
    // ... hardcoded data
  }
];
setAssignments(demoAssignments);
```

**AFTER (Real API)**:
```tsx
// Call the assignments API that now supports students
const response = await fetch('/api/assignments', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();

// Transform API data to match frontend interface
const transformedAssignments: Assignment[] = data.data.assignments.map((assignment: ApiAssignment) => ({
  id: assignment.id,
  title: assignment.title,
  description: assignment.description,
  deadline: assignment.deadline,
  status: assignment.studentSubmission?.status || 'NOT_SUBMITTED',
  type: assignment.type,
  points: assignment.points,
  subject: assignment.subject,
  submission: assignment.studentSubmission ? {
    id: assignment.studentSubmission.id,
    score: assignment.studentSubmission.score,
    feedback: assignment.studentSubmission.feedback,
    submittedAt: assignment.studentSubmission.submittedAt
  } : undefined
}));
```

### Test Results:

#### API Response for Maya Sari (Student):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "assignments": [
      {
        "id": "cmd7dseho008hu8n8n6mo79r0",
        "title": "Tugas Bahasa Indonesia - Menulis Puisi",
        "description": "Buat puisi dengan tema alam sebanyak 4 bait",
        "type": "TUGAS_HARIAN",
        "points": 75,
        "deadline": "2025-07-22T12:43:23.421Z",
        "class": {
          "id": "cmd7drrvd000ou8n8rq8sm0u1",
          "name": "VII B"
        },
        "subject": null,
        "teacher": {
          "id": "cmd7drqc8000eu8n8rodhkx0x",
          "fullName": "Siti Nurhaliza, S.Pd"
        },
        "studentSubmission": {
          "id": "cmd7dsfz8008zu8n85nscrzrl",
          "status": "GRADED",
          "submittedAt": "2025-07-15T12:43:24.980Z",
          "score": 75,
          "feedback": "Grade corrected to match assignment points",
          "gradedAt": "2025-07-18T18:06:11.486Z"
        }
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "currentPage": 1,
      "perPage": 10,
      "total": 1,
      "totalPages": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Real Database Data**: Student assignments now come from actual database
- âœ… **Dynamic Content**: Shows assignments specific to student's class (VII B)
- âœ… **Submission Status**: Displays real submission status ("GRADED")
- âœ… **Scores & Feedback**: Shows actual grades (75/75) and teacher feedback
- âœ… **Teacher Info**: Displays real teacher name (Siti Nurhaliza, S.Pd)
- âœ… **Deadlines**: Shows actual assignment deadlines from database

### Impact:
- Students now see their actual assignments instead of fake demo data
- Assignment status reflects real submission and grading state
- Consistent data across teacher and student views
- Proper synchronization between assignment creation and student visibility

**The student assignment page is now fully connected to the database! ðŸŽ‰**
