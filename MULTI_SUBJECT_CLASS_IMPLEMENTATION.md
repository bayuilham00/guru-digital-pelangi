# Multi-Subject Class Management Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goal**
Implement multi-subject class management where:
- Students can be enrolled in multiple subjects within the same physical class
- Teachers can teach different subjects in different classes
- Approval system for enrollment and transfers
- Auto-enrollment when new subjects are added to a class

## âœ… **Task Checklist**
