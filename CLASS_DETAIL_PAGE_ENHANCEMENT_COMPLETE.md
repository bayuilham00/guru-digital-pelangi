### 2. Enhanced ClassDetailPage Features
- **Real-time data loading** from backend APIs
- **Improved action handlers** for student and assignment management
- **Better error states** with retry functionality
- **Responsive design** with proper loading states

### 3. New EnhancedClassDetailPage Component
Created a completely new enhanced version with:
- **Toast notifications** using react-hot-toast
- **Modal interfaces** for detailed student and assignment views
- **Advanced filtering and export** capabilities (placeholders)
- **Improved typography and icons**
- **Better accessibility** with tooltips and proper ARIA labels

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **TypeScript compliance** with proper type definitions
- **Error boundary patterns** for graceful error handling

## Integration Points

### Backend APIs Used
- `/classes/:classId/full` - Complete class information
- `/classes/:classId/students` - Student enrollment data
- `/grades/class/:classId` - Grade information
- `/assignments/class/:classId` - Assignment data
- `/grades/stats/class/:classId` - Statistical summaries

### Demo Mode Support
- **Fallback to demo data** when backend is unavailable
- **Environment-based switching** via DEMO_MODE flag
- **Consistent data structure** between demo and production

## Future Enhancements Ready

### Planned Features (UI Complete)
1. **Real-time updates** with WebSocket integration
2. **Advanced filtering and search** functionality
3. **Data export** to CSV/PDF formats
4. **Bulk operations** for student management
5. **Assignment creation wizard** directly from class page
6. **Attendance tracking** integration
7. **Grade analytics** with detailed charts

### Extension Points
- **Plugin architecture** for custom widgets
- **Theme customization** support
- **Internationalization** ready structure
- **Mobile app** compatibility

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `src/services/classService.ts` - Added comprehensive API methods
