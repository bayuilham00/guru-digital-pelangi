# EXECUTION GUIDE: Multi-Subject Database Migration

## Ready to Execute? ‚úÖ

All files have been prepared for the migration to multi-subject classes. Here's your step-by-step execution plan:

---

## üéØ **STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Migration Backup (CRITICAL!)**

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd "d:\CascadeProjects\guru-digital-pelangi"

# 2. Create database backup (MANDATORY!)
./backup-database.ps1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT BACKUP! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

---

### **Phase 2: Execute Migration Script**

```powershell
# Run the complete migration
./run-migration.ps1

# OR for testing first:
./run-migration.ps1 -TestMode

# OR if you want to skip backup (NOT RECOMMENDED):
./run-migration.ps1 -SkipBackup
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Create database backup
- ‚úÖ Execute SQL migration (add new tables + migrate data)
- ‚úÖ Update Prisma client
- ‚úÖ Verify migration success

---

### **Phase 3: Restart Backend Server**

```powershell
# Stop current backend server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm run dev
```

---

### **Phase 4: Test Multi-Subject Functionality**

1. **Open ClassManager in frontend**
2. **Click "Subjects" button on any class** - should work without 403/500 errors
3. **Test adding new subjects to classes**
4. **Test assigning teachers to specific subjects**
5. **Verify all existing data still works**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY FEATURES BUILT-IN**

- **‚úÖ Backward Compatibility**: Existing single-subject classes continue to work
- **‚úÖ Data Migration**: All current data automatically moved to new structure
- **‚úÖ Rollback Ready**: Database backup created for instant rollback if needed
- **‚úÖ Dual Schema Support**: APIs work with both old and new data structures

---

## üìä **WHAT THE MIGRATION DOES**

### **New Tables Created:**
- `class_subjects` - Junction table for class ‚Üî multiple subjects
- `class_teacher_subjects` - Teachers assigned to specific class-subject combinations  
- `student_subject_enrollments` - Students enrolled in specific class-subject combinations

### **Data Migration:**
- **Classes with subjects** ‚Üí Create `ClassSubject` entries
- **Teacher assignments** ‚Üí Convert `ClassTeacher` to `ClassTeacherSubject` entries
- **Student enrollments** ‚Üí Create `StudentSubjectEnrollment` for all current students

### **Schema Updates:**
- **Class model**: Added `isPhysicalClass` field + new relations
- **Subject model**: Added multi-subject relations
- **User model**: Added `ClassTeacherSubject` relation
- **Student model**: Added `StudentSubjectEnrollment` relation

---

## üîß **API ENDPOINTS NOW AVAILABLE**

After migration, these endpoints will work with the new schema:

```
GET    /api/admin/classes/:id/full                          # Get class with all subjects
POST   /api/admin/classes/:id/subjects                      # Add subject to class  
POST   /api/admin/classes/:id/subjects/:subjectId/teachers  # Assign teacher to subject
DELETE /api/admin/classes/:id/subjects/:subjectId           # Remove subject from class
```

---

## üö® **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Quick Rollback:**
```powershell
# Restore from backup (replace with your backup filename)
mysql -u root -p guru_digital_pelangi < backup_guru_digital_pelangi_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

# Revert Prisma schema changes
git checkout backend/prisma/schema.prisma

# Regenerate old Prisma client
cd backend
npx prisma generate
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

**"Access denied" errors:**
- Make sure MySQL is running and credentials are correct
- Run PowerShell as Administrator if needed

**"Prisma generate failed":**
- Check for syntax errors in schema.prisma
- Restart VS Code and try again

**"Frontend still shows errors":**
- Clear browser cache
- Restart frontend dev server
- Check browser console for details

---

## üéâ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know the migration succeeded when:

‚úÖ Migration script shows "MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"  
‚úÖ No errors in backend server console  
‚úÖ ClassManager "Subjects" button opens modal successfully  
‚úÖ Can add new subjects to classes  
‚úÖ Can assign teachers to specific subjects  
‚úÖ All existing classes still display correctly  

---

## üöÄ **READY TO EXECUTE?**

Type this command when you're ready:

```powershell
./run-migration.ps1
```

**The migration should take about 2-5 minutes to complete.**

Good luck! üçÄ
