# ✅ ASSIGNMENT STATISTICS FIX COMPLETED

## Issue Fixed:
**Submission Statistics Calculation Error**

### Problem:
- "Telah Mengumpulkan" showed **0 / 2** instead of **1 / 2**
- "Telah Dinilai" showed confusing format **1 / 0**
- Students with status `GRADED` were not counted as `submitted`

### Root Cause:
Backend logic only counted status `'SUBMITTED'` for the `submitted` statistic, but ignored students with status `'GRADED'`. This caused inconsistency:
- Maya Sari: status = "GRADED" → not counted in `submitted`
- But logically, if a submission is graded, it means it was submitted first

### Solution Applied:
Updated 3 locations in `backend/routes/assignmentRoutes.js`:

#### 1. Line 717 - getAssignmentSubmissions function:
```javascript
// BEFORE
submitted: studentsWithSubmissions.filter(s => s.submission && s.submission.status === 'SUBMITTED').length,

// AFTER  
submitted: studentsWithSubmissions.filter(s => s.submission && (s.submission.status === 'SUBMITTED' || s.submission.status === 'GRADED')).length,
```

#### 2. Line 232 - Assignment list stats:
```javascript
// BEFORE
submitted: submissionStats.find(s => s.status === 'SUBMITTED')?._count?.status || 0,

// AFTER
submitted: (submissionStats.find(s => s.status === 'SUBMITTED')?._count?.status || 0) + 
          (submissionStats.find(s => s.status === 'GRADED')?._count?.status || 0),
```

#### 3. Line 326 - Single assignment stats:
```javascript
// BEFORE
submitted: submissionStats.find(s => s.status === 'SUBMITTED')?._count?.status || 0,

// AFTER
submitted: (submissionStats.find(s => s.status === 'SUBMITTED')?._count?.status || 0) + 
          (submissionStats.find(s => s.status === 'GRADED')?._count?.status || 0),
```

### Test Results:

#### API Response BEFORE:
```json
"submissionStats": {
  "total": 2,
  "submitted": 0,  ❌
  "missing": 1,
  "graded": 1,
  "late": 0
}
```

#### API Response AFTER:
```json
"submissionStats": {
  "total": 2,
  "submitted": 1,  ✅
  "missing": 1,
  "graded": 1, 
  "late": 0
}
```

### Frontend Display:
- **"Telah Mengumpulkan"**: 1 / 2 ✅ (correctly shows Maya Sari submitted)
- **"Telah Dinilai"**: 1 / 2 ✅ (correctly shows 1 graded out of 2 total)

### Impact:
- ✅ Accurate submission statistics
- ✅ Correct progress tracking for teachers
- ✅ Consistent data across all assignment views
- ✅ Better insight into class completion rates

This fix ensures that graded submissions are properly counted as submitted, providing accurate statistics for teachers to track their class progress.
