# GradeStats Runtime Error Fix

## Problem
The GradeStats component was throwing a runtime error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'totalStudents')" when selecting a class in the grade management module.

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between the props interface and what was being passed:
- **Expected**: A single `stats` prop with pre-calculated statistics
- **Actual**: Individual props (`grades`, `students`, `selectedClass`, `selectedGradeType`) from GradeManager

## Solution
Updated the GradeStats component to:

1. **Accept the correct props** that are actually being passed from GradeManager:
   ```typescript
   interface GradeStatsProps {
     grades: GradeRecord[];
     students: GradeStudent[];
     selectedClass: string;
     selectedGradeType: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Calculate stats internally** using `useMemo` for performance:
   - Filter grades by selected class and grade type
   - Calculate percentages for each grade (score/maxScore * 100)
   - Compute statistics: average, highest, lowest, pass rate

3. **Add comprehensive defensive coding**:
   - Check for null/undefined arrays
   - Handle empty grade arrays
   - Use optional chaining and fallback values
   - Guard against division by zero

4. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Return loading state when data is unavailable
   - Safe rendering with null checks
   - Graceful degradation with meaningful defaults

## Key Features
- **Real-time calculation**: Stats update automatically when class/grade type changes
- **Performance optimized**: Uses memoization to avoid unnecessary recalculations
- **Robust error handling**: Handles all edge cases gracefully
- **Type safety**: Uses proper TypeScript interfaces from gradeTypes

## Files Modified
- `src/components/modules/grade/components/GradeStats.tsx`
  - Updated props interface
  - Added stats calculation logic
  - Added defensive coding and error boundaries
  - Improved type safety

## Testing
The component now safely handles:
- ✅ Empty grade arrays
- ✅ Null/undefined props
- ✅ Classes with no grades
- ✅ Invalid score/maxScore values
- ✅ Missing student data

## Statistics Calculated
1. **Total Students**: Count of students in selected class
2. **Average Grade**: Mean percentage across all grades
3. **Highest Grade**: Maximum percentage achieved
4. **Lowest Grade**: Minimum percentage achieved  
5. **Pass Rate**: Percentage of students with grades ≥70%

All statistics are rounded to 1 decimal place for consistent display.
